Hi! I'm Amira Merzougui.

### Electrical and computing Engineer focused on the intersection of hardware, software, and intelligent systems.

My work is driven by a simple principle: to build the "brains" behind the machine. I started in industrial automation, but my curiosity pulled me deeper—into the control theory, computer vision, and embedded logic that make autonomous systems possible. I architect and build end-to-end solutions for complex, real-world problems.
