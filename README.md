I'm a third-year Industrial IT and Automation Engineering student from Tunisia, but my real passion is building the core intelligence behind smart systems. My journey started in industrial automation, but I quickly discovered I was more fascinated by building the "brains" of a system—the control algorithms, the computer vision, and the embedded hardware—than the factory floor itself.

This has led me to focus on **Robotics**, **Human-Computer Interaction**, and **Embedded Systems**. I love the challenge of taking a complex problem and building a complete solution, from the circuit board up to the AI model.

### 🛠️ What I'm Currently Building

I learn best by doing. Here are the projects I'm currently focused on:

- 🚗 **Driver Wellness & Safety System:** An IoT system that uses computer vision and biometric sensors to monitor a driver's state and provide real-time safety advice. A deep dive into applied HCI and embedded AI.
- 🛰️ **Autonomous CubeSat Power System:** My team's project for the IEEE TSYP13 Challenge. We're designing an AI-driven system to predict and prevent power failures in a 3U CubeSat, operating entirely without ground control.
